      Let's write here about Mark Smiley so he can finish this assignment and go
      to institute
    </h1>
    <p>
      I'm starting to regret making this my theme but it's late and I don't have
      much energy to go back and change it
    </p>
    <h3>Let's talk about Mark's projects yeah? yeah:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>A playlist algorithm that stores and organizes songs</li>
      <li>A datalog parser and interpreter</li>
      <li>A spelling corrector</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Ok, now let's hear work experience, ranked from top to bottom, least
      helpful in software development to most helpful:
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Dug foundations:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          He was literally a grunt for several years on a team that dug
          foundations
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Sprinkler tech:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At least he was using his head and solving multiple problems while
          under a time constraint
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Missionary:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Does this count? I'd say maybe enough to make the list look more
          impressive
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
