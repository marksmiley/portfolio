    <h3>Let's take a look at his projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a class="active" href="#home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="PhotoWebsite.html">Photo website</a></li>

      Ok, now let's hear work experience, ranked from top to bottom, least
      helpful in software development to most helpful:
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Dug foundations:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          He was literally a grunt for several years on a team that dug
          foundations
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Sprinkler tech:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At least he was using his head and solving multiple problems while
          under a time constraint
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Missionary:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Does this count? I'd say maybe enough to make the list look more
          impressive
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
